We uploaded the dataset of concept drift and code obfuscation. We will give a brief introduction in the following.


* concept_drift_data: Testing sets for each detector for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020. 
* concept_drift_data_txt: The sha256 of the APK file and the corresponding year.
* obfuscation_data: Code obfuscation test set. There are eight tpyes of obfuscation: 'Rebuild', 'Reflection', 'Reorder', 'CallIndirection', 'ClassRename', 'ConstStringEncryption', 'Junkcode' and 'MethodRename'.
* obfuscation_data_txt: The sha256 of the APK file and the corresponding obfuscation types.

Note that some detectors' dataset are too large to upload successfully. We will provide a link to the cloud drive in the future.
